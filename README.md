# HRDiscBot

This is a personal project, the original intent was to adapt Ultimate Werewolf (Bezier Games, 2008) so that it could be played over discord, however I also wanted to make The Resistance: Avalon (Indie Boards & Cards, 2012), so I ended up making a debatably new game that incorporates my favorite elements of both games.

The game is played over Discord, you could make the bot and add it to your server but I would recommend to create a new server and add it to that one instead, just in case.

### Current functionality

Running a semi-complete game in a single server.

### Planned functionality

More player roles, new challenges, being able to run multiple games in a single server, saving stats, new role selecting algorithm.

## Set-up

<ol>
<li>Create a Discord bot</li>
    If you're not sure how to do it, follow this ![Guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html)
<li>Get the latest release from this page</li>
<li>Add your bot key</li>
    Create a file called botKey.py in the folder where you put the release and write "key='your bot key here'" into it.
<li>Create a new Discord server and invite the bot</li>
<li>Run the .exe file and you're good to go!</li>
</ol>
