# HRDiscBot
 
This is a personal project, the original intent was to adapt Ultimate Werewolf (Bezier Games, 2008) so that it could be played over discord, however I also wanted to make The Resistance: Avalong (Indie Boards & Cards, 2012), so I ended up making a debatably new game that incorporates my favorite elements of both games.

The game is played over discord, you could make the bot and add it to your server but I would recommend to create a new server and add it to that one instead, just in case.

### Current functionality

Running a semi-complete game in a single server.

### Planned functionality

More player roles, new challenges, being able to run multiple games in a single server, saving stats, new role selecting algorithm.
